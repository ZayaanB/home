                <h3 class="subheading">Classical</h3>
                <p>
                    Classical guitars are often what most guitarists begin playing, this is because classical guitars offer the feel of traditional acoustic guitars. 
                    Unlike acoustic guitars, classical guitars are a litter smaller making it easier to hold and classical guitar strings are made of nylon instead 
                    of steel like other guitars. This produces less of a bright tone and the sound resonates less. An easy way to distinguish acoustic and classical guitars
                    is their heads. Classical guitars have a hold in their heads where the strings are wrapped whereas acoustic guitars have pegs to wrap strings tightly.
                    Additionally, the classical guitar has 12 frets making a lower range of pitches but also making it easier to play.

                <h3 class="subheading">Acoustic</h3>
                <p>
                    Acoustic guitars are similar to classical guitars, like we said above acoustic guitars have steel strings that produce a bright resonating sound and regular size acoustic guitars
                    range between 38-42 inches. Acoustic guitars can be found throughout pop, country and other genres of music due to their flexibility and large range, full sized (4/4) acoustic guitars
                    have around 20 fret or 20 semi-tones. Due to the acoustic guitar&rsquo;s steel strings, it can be a difficult instrument to play if one has sensitive fingers otherwise in my opinion, they are 
                    both require relatively the same amount of effort and practice.

                <h3 class="subheading">Electro-acoustic</h3>
                <p>
                    Electro-acoustic as the name suggests, is a mixture of acoustic and electric guitars. This means electro acoustic guitars sound exactly like acoustic guitars with all the same features like
                    20 frets and size but they are also able to be directly connected to an amplifier. Amplifiers can change the guitar&rsquo;s volume, treble, bass and more making it more flexible for different genres
                    or music. One way to distinguish between an acoustic and electro-acoustic guitar is by looking at the sides of their bodies, electro-acoustic guitars have pegs to change volume and other 
                    settings on the amplifier, additionally electro-acoustic guitars have a input jack where the aux cable can be connected from the guitar to the amplifier.

                <h3 class="subheading">Electric</h3>
                <p>
                    Electric guitars were invented in 1931 by Geroge Beauchamp. They use wires that are connected by magnets that change the vibration of the strings into electric current. Electric guitars
                    use things called pickups to produce and modify songs when connected to amplifiers. Electric guitars have 6 stings like acoustic guitars and 20-24 frets, an easy way to identify an electric
                    guitar is if the guitar has 6 strings and no sound hole which is a big hold in the center of the body then the guitar is electric. Electric guitars are significantly easier to play than acoustic 
                    due to their lighter strings which makes them easier to fret and pick. Electric guitars are known for their flexibility of playing many genres of music, from rock to country.

                <h3 class="subheading">Bass</h3>
                <p>
                    The bass guitar also simply known as the bass is the lowest pitched member of the guitar family, it typically has 6 strings and their role in modern music is as background accompaniment. The bass 
                    is similar in appearance to an electric guitar, to produce the lower sound the bass guitar has thicker strings than other guitars. Bass guitars are usually played with plectrums like the electric guitar.

                <h3 class="subheading">Ukulele</h3>
                <p>
                    The ukulele is a member of a lute family which is smaller than the other guitars and typically has 6 strings. A ukulele has a variety of pitches which changes based on the sizes, a ukulele has 6 sizes: 
                    soprano, tenor, concert, and baritone. The ukulele is often associated with music from Hawaii because of the short strums that are accompanied with singing. The ukulele originated in the 19th century in Hawaii.
