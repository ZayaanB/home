                The guitar is a musical instrument typically with 6-strings, it originated from Spain in the 16th century. Modern day guitars have 6 main variations being the 
                acoustic, electro-acousitc, ukulele, electric, classical, and bass in no particular order. According to studies conducted the guitar is the second most
                popular instrument in the world only beat by the piano, this shows that if you are into music and want to try something new the guitar is for you! Remember to play
                an instruemnt you should also learn some theory, a good starter book is <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Guitar-Theory-Dummies-Online-Instruction/dp/1118646770">Guitar Theory for Dummies.</a>

                        The closest relative of the guitar originated in Spain during the 16th century, in this time guitars were played with a feather because Faxardo wrote &ldquo; won&rsquo;t 
                        bear the fingers but must be touched with a fine quill to make it exert its harmony.&rdquo; This gave modern guitarists the idea of playing with a pick, but later in the early 1700s guitarists
                        needed a way to play multiple notes at once and this is when playing with fingers was invented. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Baroque period was one of the most important to the history of the guitar because this is when the guitar&rsquo;s popularity grew and the guitar went from being played with 5 strings to usually having 
                        six or four strings. Also multiple strings put together on a guitar was replaced with a single string making it easier to pick.

            <p>
                The guitar is a popular instrument in most modern day music, but instead of playing the lead guitars often play chords which are 3 or more notes 
                played together. Chords compliment the lead instrument or singer by matching their tone, there are many diffirent types of chords which produce diffirent pitches.
                Guitar notations can be written in 2 forms, tabs and music notations. Tabs also known as guitar tablature are easier to read 
                making it a common choice, whereas music notations are used by schools and more skilled players as they develop music theory skills and are the &ldquo;correct way&rdquo; 
                of reading music according tosome musicians. An additional advantage of music notations is that tabs are limited to the guitar so if you want to learn another instrument music sheets 
                are the way to go!

                Today guitars are used in all genres of music from pop to classical, even electro! Despite being able to play all genres some types of guitars play some genres best, for example electrical guitars
                are usually used for rock and pop while acoustic and classical guitars are used for pop and classical music. The strings of the guitars have names which usually are universal but have some exceptions, 
                the top and thickest string produces the lowest sound whereas the lowest string produces the highest pitch sound. On electrical, classical, and acoustic guitar the strings are E, A, D, G, B, E from lowest 
                to highest. A common acronym that guitarists use to remember this is: Eddie ate dynamite good bye Eddie. The E string is both the top and bottom string so they are called low E and high E respectively.
                The bass guitar is the first exception with only having 4 strings but still very easy to remember as they are just the first 4 strings, E, A, D, G. For this you can use the same acronym but don&rsquo;t use bye Eddie.
                Lastly the ukulele uses the acronym: good children eat apples. The notes from lowest to highest are G, C, E, A; just like the bass the ukulele only has 4 strings.

                        A plectrum is used like a feather with old guitars, plectrums also known as picks are used to pluck strings and strum they produce a bright and make strings easier to pick for beginners but limits you to 
                        strumming ot plucking one string at a time. Plectrums also come in many diffirent sizes and shape which can produce diffierent tones. The most common is a teardrop shape made out of celluloid which is a plastic.
                        Thicker plectrums usually produce a softer/warmer tone whereas thinner picks produce a bright sound.

                    <p>
                        Amplifiers often called amps are used to increase the sound produced by a guitar, amps can be used with an aux cable if you are using an electric or electro-acoustic guitars. 
                        With other types of guitars you must install a pickup which is basically a mic that picks up the sounds made by the strings and then you can connect the pickup to an amplifier to boost the sound.
                        Amplifiers can control not only the volume of the guitar but also the treble, prescence, bass, and the tone of a guitar with turnable pegs on the amp or the body of the guitar.
